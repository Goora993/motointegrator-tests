In Jira Xray, we can use Datasets and variables in designing test cases.
In the task it is required to use Action, Data and Expected Result sections so I assume that the main tool is Jira Xray.
Then I decided to design my test case for using Datasets and variables.

No matter which service we choose, in all cases the pattern of behavior is exactly the same:
       the most popular services on the main page -> list of the largest cities on the page of a specific service ->
       results search page with workshop list -> workshop details
So I thought it would be a good idea to design a generic test case that can use different inputs in different situations.
For example, we can check the second tire shop from the Lublin list or the fourth battery shop from the Warsaw list.

Variables:
    app_main_page=https://motointegrator.com/pl/en/
    service=Tires Change
    city=Lublin
    workshop_index=2
    expected_hours_range=08:00 - 18:00
    expected_workshop_rating=5

Test case: Open workshop details using tiles.

Step 1:
Action:
    Navigate to app main page.
Data:
    App main page: ${app_main_page}
Expected Result:
    Main page loaded successfully.

Step 2:
Action:
    Scroll down to the tiles of the most popular services and hover over the service tile.
Data:
    Service: ${service}
Expected Result:
    The background of the tile has changed to one that shows the service activity.
    A blue button with white text "Learn More" is also shown.

Step 3:
Action:
    Click the service tile.
Data:
    Service: ${service}
Expected Result:
    Service page loaded successfully.

Step 4:
Action:
    Scroll down to the list of available largest cities and click the button with the city name.
Data:
    City: ${city}
Expected Result:
    Search result page loaded successfully.

Step 5:
Action:
    Scroll down to the workshop which details you want to open and click on its image.
    (Optional: if the workshop you want to open is further than the first page, change the page)
Data:
    Workshop on the list: ${workshop_index}
Expected Result:
    Workshop details page loaded successfully.
    "Now open" label should be displayed,
        it should have hours range ${expected_hours_range} on the right.

Step 6:
Action:
    Scroll down to the workshop rating section.
Data:
Expected Result:
    Workshop rating should be equal ${expected_workshop_rating}
